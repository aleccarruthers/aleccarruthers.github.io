My name is Alec and I perform Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for a living.</p> <p>One of the main goals I have for this site is to highlight what I see as open problems and the limitations of current approaches. This could take the form of outlining the approach of a new paper, describing my thoughts about current approaches, sharing preliminary research, and or performing small scale experiments to demonstrate weakness of current models.</p> <p>I will focus primarily on my interest areas, which are quite broad, but also hope to expand to other areas:</p> <ul> <li>Generative Modeling: autoregression, diffusion, normalizing flows, GANs</li> <li>Generalization and Open-Endedness</li> <li>Reinforcement Learning</li> <li>AI Safety</li> </ul> </body></html>
