Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! My name is Alec and I perform Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for a living. 

One of the main goals I have for this site is to highlight what I see as open problems and the limitations of current approaches.
This could take the form of outlining the approach of a new paper, describing my thoughts about current approaches, sharing preliminary research, and or 
performing small scale experiments to demonstrate weakness of current models.

I will focus primarily on my interest areas, which are quite broad, but also hope to expand to other areas:
- Generative Modeling: autoregression, diffusion, normalizing flows, GANs
- Generalization and Open-Endedness
- Reinforcement Learning
- AI Safety
