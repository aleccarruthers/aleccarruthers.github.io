Hello! My name is Alec and I perform Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for a living.

One of the main goals I have for this site is to highlight what I see as open problems and the limitations of current approaches.
This could take the form of outlining the approach of a new paper, describing my thoughts about current approaches, sharing preliminary research, and or
performing small scale experiments to demonstrate weakness of current models.

I will focus primarily on my interest areas, which are quite broad, but also hope to expand to other areas:

- Generative Modeling: autoregression, diffusion, normalizing flows, GANs
- Generalization and Open-Endedness
- Reinforcement Learning
- AI Safety
